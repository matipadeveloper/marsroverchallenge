# marsroverchallenge
Code based on implementing the mars rover challenge which involves building a small application that reads instructions and navigates accordlingly.

The code base has a main driver class, one emum called Direction and two objects called Rover and Mars. This is a terminal application that runs with java. The application loads its data from the roverinstruction.txt and that then initialises both the Mars and Rover objects. Those objects are then used to make the object move accordlingly. Strong validation has been implmented so feel free to manipulate the text file as you wish and you will be presented with errors based on that input.

*For the second input for the initial position of the rover please separate x and y coordinates with a space*
